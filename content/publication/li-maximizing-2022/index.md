abstract: We study the problem of channel uncertainty on wireless transmissions from
  different users with mutual interference. Specifically, the channel gains from the
  transmitters to the receivers are available only through their mean and covariance
  rather than complete distributions. Our goal is to maximize the energy efficiency
  among all transmitter-receiver pairs while guaranteeing their capacity requirements.
  For this problem, we employ chance-constrained programming (CCP), which allows occasional
  violation of target capacity threshold as long as the probability of such violation
  is below a small tolerable constant (risk level). We propose a solution based on
  a novel reformulation technique that converts the original CCP into a deterministic
  optimization problem without relaxation errors. Then the deterministic optimization
  problem is approximated into a Geometric Program (GP) based on tight polynomial
  approximations, which can be solved optimally. We prove that our proposed solution
  achieves near-optimal performance with polynomial time complexity.
