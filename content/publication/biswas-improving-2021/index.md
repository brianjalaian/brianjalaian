abstract: We propose a novel Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) based on the Differential
  Evolution algorithm for solving global numerical optimization problem in real-valued
  continuous parameter space. The proposed MadDE algorithm leverages the power of
  the multiple adaptation strategy with respect to the control parameters and search
  mechanisms, and is tested on the benchmark functions taken from the CEC 2021 special
  session & competition on single-objective bound-constrained optimization. Experimental
  results indicate that MadDE is able to achieve superior performance on global numerical
  optimization problems when compared against state-of-the-art real-parameter optimizers.
  We also provide a hyperparameter optimization algorithm SUBHO for improving the
  search performance of any EA by finding an optimal set of control parameters, and
  demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing MadDE's performance on the same benchmark.
  The source code of our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/subhodipbiswas/MadDE.
