abstract: Robustness against real-world distribution shifts is crucial for the successful
  deployment of object detection models in practical applications. In this paper,
  we address the problem of assessing and enhancing the robustness of object detection
  models against natural perturbations, such as varying lighting conditions, blur,
  and brightness. We analyze four state-of-the-art deep neural network models, Detr-ResNet-101,
  Detr-ResNet-50, YOLOv4, and YOLOv4-tiny, using the COCO 2017 dataset and ExDark
  dataset. By simulating synthetic perturbations with the AugLy package, we systematically
  explore the optimal level of synthetic perturbation required to improve the models
  robustness through data augmentation techniques. Our comprehensive ablation study
  meticulously evaluates the impact of synthetic perturbations on object detection
  models performance against real-world distribution shifts, establishing a tangible
  connection between synthetic augmentation and real-world robustness. Our findings
  not only substantiate the effectiveness of synthetic perturbations in improving
  model robustness, but also provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners
  in developing more robust and reliable object detection models tailored for real-world
  applications.
