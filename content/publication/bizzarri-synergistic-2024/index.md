abstract: The prevailing approaches in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)
  are often hampered by issues such as high resource consumption, significant computational
  demands, and poor interpretability. Furthermore, these systems generally struggle
  to identify novel, rapidly changing cyber threats. This paper delves into the potential
  of incorporating Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) into NIDS, combining
  deep learning's data-driven strengths with symbolic AI's logical reasoning to tackle
  the dynamic challenges in cybersecurity, which also includes detailed NSAI techniques
  introduction for cyber professionals to explore the potential strengths of NSAI
  in NIDS. The inclusion of NSAI in NIDS marks potential advancements in both the
  detection and interpretation of intricate network threats, benefiting from the robust
  pattern recognition of neural networks and the interpretive prowess of symbolic
  reasoning. By analyzing network traffic data types and machine learning architectures,
  we illustrate NSAI's distinctive capability to offer more profound insights into
  network behavior, thereby improving both detection performance and the adaptability
  of the system. This merging of technologies not only enhances the functionality
  of traditional NIDS but also sets the stage for future developments in building
  more resilient, interpretable, and dynamic defense mechanisms against advanced cyber
  threats. The continued progress in this area is poised to transform NIDS into a
  system that is both responsive to known threats and anticipatory of emerging, unseen
  ones.
