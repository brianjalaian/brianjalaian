abstract: Robustness against distribution shifts is crucial for object detection models
  in real-world applications. In this study, we evaluate the performance of four state-of-the-art
  models against natural perturbations, retrain them with synthetic perturbations
  using the AugLy augmentation package, and assess their improved performance against
  natural perturbations. Our empirical ablation study focuses on the brightness perturbation
  modality using the COCO 2017 and ExDARK datasets. Our findings suggest that synthetic
  perturbations can effectively improve model robustness against real-world distribution
  shifts, providing valuable insights for deploying robust object detection models
  in real-world scenarios.
