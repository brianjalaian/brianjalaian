abstract: In the face of escalating cyber threats, traditional security measures often
  fall short, prompting the need for more advanced and interpretable solutions. Neurosymbolic
  AI, which synergistically combines the pattern recognition capabilities of neural
  networks with the explicit reasoning of symbolic systems, presents a promising avenue
  in this realm. This paper offers a comprehensive exploration of Neurosymbolic AI
  and its potential in enhancing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By integrating
  data-driven learning with structured reasoning, Neurosymbolic AI promises more robust,
  adaptive, and transparent cybersecurity solutions. However, challenges such as model
  interpretability, data requirements, and adaptability in dynamic threat landscapes
  persist. This paper provides an overview of these challenges, emphasizing the transformative
  potential of Neurosymbolic AI in fortifying the cybersecurity domain.
