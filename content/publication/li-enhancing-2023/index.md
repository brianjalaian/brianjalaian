abstract: Task offloading is a powerful tool in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However,
  in many practical scenarios, the number of required processing cycles of a task
  is unknown beforehand and only known until its completion. This poses a serious
  challenge in making offloading decisions as the number of processing cycles is a
  key parameter to determine whether a task’s deadline can be met. To cope with such
  processing uncertainty, we formulate a Chance-Constrained Program (CCP) that offers
  probabilistic guarantees to task deadlines. The goal is to minimize energy consumption
  for the users while meeting the probabilistic task deadlines. We assume that only
  the means and variances of the random processing cycles are available, without any
  knowledge of distribution functions. We employ a powerful tool called Exact Conic
  Reformulation (ECR) that reformulates probabilistic deadline constraints into deterministic
  ones. Subsequently, we design an online solution called EPD (Energy-minimized solution
  with Probabilistic Deadline guarantee) for periodic scheduling and schedule updates
  during run-time. We show that EPD can address the processing uncertainty with probabilistic
  deadline guarantees while minimizing the users’ energy consumption.
