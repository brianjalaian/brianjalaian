abstract: The Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) is a dynamically composed network
  of intelligent sensors and actuators that operate as a command and control, communications,
  computers, and intelligence complex-system with the aim to enable multi-domain operations.
  The use of artificial intelligence can help transform the IoBT data into actionable
  insight to create information and decision advantage on the battlefield. In this
  work, we focus on how accounting for uncertainty in IoBT systems can result in more
  robust and safer systems. Human trust in these systems requires the ability to understand
  and interpret how machines make decisions. Most real-world applications currently
  use deterministic machine learning techniques that cannot incorporate uncertainty.
  In this work, we focus on the machine learning task of classifying vehicles from
  their audio recordings, comparing deterministic convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
  with Bayesian CNNs to show that correctly estimating the uncertainty can help lead
  to robust decision-making in IoBT.
