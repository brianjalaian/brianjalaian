abstract: Multi-dimensional uncertainties often modulate modern system dynamics in
  a complicated fashion. They lead to challenges for real-time control, considering
  the significant computation load needed to evaluate them in real-time decision processes.
  This chapter describes the use of computationally effective uncertainty evaluation
  methods for adaptive optimal control, including learning control and differential
  games. Two uncertainty evaluation methods are described, the multivariate probabilistic
  collocation method (MPCM) and its extension the MPCM-OFFD that integrates the MPCM
  with the orthogonal fractional factorial design (OFFD) to break the curse of dimensionality.
  These scalable uncertainty evaluation methods are then developed for reinforcement
  learning (RL)-based adaptive optimal control. Stochastic differential games, including
  the two-player zero-sum and multi-player nonzero-sum games, are formulated and investigated.
  Nash equilibrium solutions for these games are found in real time using the MPCM-based
  on-policy/off-policy RL methods. Real-world applications on broad-band long-distance
  aerial networking and strategic air traffic management demonstrate the practical
  use of MPCM- and MPCM-OFFD-based learning control for uncertain systems.
