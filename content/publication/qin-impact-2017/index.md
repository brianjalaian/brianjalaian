abstract: Â© 2016 IEEE. There have been some rapid advances on the design of full duplex
  (FD) transceivers in recent years. Although the benefits of FD have been studied
  for single-hop wireless communications, its potential on throughput performance
  in a multi-hop wireless network remains unclear. As for multi-hop networks, a fundamental
  problem is to compute the achievable end-to-end throughput for one or multiple communication
  sessions. The goal of this paper is to offer some fundamental understanding on end-to-end
  throughput performance limits of FD in a multi-hop wireless network. Weshow that
  through a rigorous mathematical formulation, we can cast the multi-hop throughput
  performance probleminto a formal optimization problem. Through numerical results,
  we show that in many cases, the end-to-end session throughput in a FD network can
  exceed 2 of that in a half duplex (HD) network. Our finding can be explained by
  the much larger design space for scheduling that is offered by removing HD constraints
  in throughput maximization problem. The results in this paper offer some new understandings
  on the potential benefits of FD for end-to-end session throughput in a multi-hop
  wireless network.
