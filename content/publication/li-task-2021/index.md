abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged to be an integral component of 5G
  infrastructure due to its potential to speed up task processing and reduce energy
  consumption for mobile devices. However, a major technical challenge in making offloading
  decisions is that the number of required processing cycles of a task is usually
  unknown in advance. Due to this processing uncertainty, it is difficult to make
  offloading decisions while providing any guarantee on task deadlines. To address
  this challenge, we propose EPD---Energy-minimized solution with Probabilistic Deadline
  guarantee to task offloading problem. The mathematical foundation of EPD is Exact
  Conic Reformulation (ECR), which is a powerful tool that reformulates a probabilistic
  constraint for task deadline into a deterministic one. In the absence of distribution
  knowledge of processing cycles, we use the estimated mean and variance of processing
  cycles and exploit ECR to the fullest extent in the design of EPD. Simulation results
  show that EPD successfully guarantees the probabilistic deadlines while minimizing
  the energy consumption of mobile users, and can achieve significant improvement
  in energy saving when compared to a state-of-the-art approach.
