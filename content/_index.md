      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I'm a passionate researcher and educator with a focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and their applications in critical domains such as finance, defense, and healthcare. My expertise spans across various areas, including large foundation models, multi-modal AI, robustness and safety in AI systems, and agentic AI design.

        As an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department and IHMC-UWF Intelligent Systems & Robotics Department at the University of West Florida, I lead research initiatives in AI assurance, safety, and efficiency. My work aims to develop robust, safe, and adaptable AI systems that can operate effectively in complex and high-stakes environments.

        I'm deeply committed to advancing the field of AI, with a particular focus on making large AI models more efficient and secure. My research often involves exploring techniques such as hardware-software co-design, distillation, quantization, and pruning to optimize and shrink large models without compromising their performance. I'm also keenly interested in adversarial AI and developing methods to ensure model safety for critical applications.

        My work often involves interdisciplinary collaborations, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications. Whether it's developing novel approaches for AI robustness, exploring the intricacies of agentic AI design, or investigating the ethical implications of AI in critical sectors, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI research and development.

        If you're interested in large language models, multi-modal AI, AI safety and robustness, or the future of efficient and secure AI systems, I'd love to connect and discuss potential collaborations or research opportunities!
