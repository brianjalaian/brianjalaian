	abstract = {© 2016 IEEE. There have been some rapid advances on the design of full duplex (FD) transceivers in recent years. Although the benefits of FD have been studied for single-hop wireless communications, its potential on throughput performance in a multi-hop wireless network remains unclear. As for multi-hop networks, a fundamental problem is to compute the achievable end-to-end throughput for one or multiple communication sessions. The goal of this paper is to offer some fundamental understanding on end-to-end throughput performance limits of FD in a multi-hop wireless network. Weshow that through a rigorous mathematical formulation, we can cast the multi-hop throughput performance probleminto a formal optimization problem. Through numerical results, we show that in many cases, the end-to-end session throughput in a FD network can exceed 2 of that in a half duplex (HD) network. Our finding can be explained by the much larger design space for scheduling that is offered by removing HD constraints in throughput maximization problem. The results in this paper offer some new understandings on the potential benefits of FD for end-to-end session throughput in a multi-hop wireless network.},

	abstract = {© 2017 IEEE. Tactical networks are generally simple ad-hoc networks in design, however, this simple design often gets complicated, when heterogeneous wireless technologies have to work together to enable seamless multi-hop communications across multiple sessions. In recent years, there has been some significant advances in computational, radio, localization, and networking te, and session's rate i.e., aggregate capacity averaged over a 4-time-slot frame)chnologies, which motivate a clean slate design of the control plane for multi-hop tactical wireless networks. In this paper, we develop a global network optimization framework, which characterizes the control plane for multi-hop wireless tactical networks. This framework abstracts the underlying complexity of tactical wireless networks and orchestrates the the control plane functions. Specifically, we develop a cross-layer optimization framework, which characterizes the interaction between the physical, link, and network layers. By applying the framework to a throughput maximization problem, we show how the proposed framework can be utilized to solve a broad range of wireless multi-hop tactical networking problems.},

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be successful in many classification tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. However, accuracy alone is not enough for high-stakes decision making. Decision makers want to know the likelihood that a specific GNN prediction is correct. For this purpose, obtaining calibrated models is essential. In this work, we perform an empirical evaluation of the calibration of state-of-the-art GNNs on multiple datasets. Our experiments show that GNNs can be calibrated in some datasets but also badly miscalibrated in others, and that state-of-the-art calibration methods are helpful but do not fix the problem.},

	abstract = {© 2015 Xue Zhang et al. Cognitive wireless sensor network (CWSN) is a combination of cognitive radio and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which can effectively solve spectrum resource scarcity problem in WSNs. As one of the key technologies in CWSNs, spectrum sensing enables sensors to detect and opportunistic access underutilized idle licensed bands, which remarkably improves the spectrum utilization and system performance. And cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) has emerged to enhance detection performance of spectrum sensing. Focusing on CSS schemes in CWSNs, this paper explores the cooperative and noncooperative schemes comprehensively. The characteristics of the existing CSS schemes are analyzed in CWSNs. And then, according to the behavior of cognitive sensors, CSS techniques are classified into noncooperative and cooperative schemes. Concentrating on energy consumption, cooperative CSS schemes are classified into three categories: censoring, clustering, and sensor selection. The performance of three kinds of CSS schemes is compared and analyzed thoroughly. Finally, the difficulties and challenges of CSS scheme are addressed in CWSNs.},

	abstract = {© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. As an enabling technology for dynamic spectrum access (DSA), cognitive radio (CR) is widely regarded as one of the most promising technologies for future the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications. Although there have been significant prior researches to combat interference on primary users (PUs), the problem of mitigating mutual interference between secondary users (SUs), -which is tightly coupled with SU's spectrum leasing- is still not understood well. This paper proposes a DSA algorithm based on game theory, which jointly performs spectrum leasing and interference mitigation among SUs. The problem is modeled as an oligopolistic competition using Stackelberg model. We have carefully studied the SU's spectrum utilization behavior with respect to various criteria of the proposed game theoretic model. Simulation results shows that, Compared with Cournot game model, the proposed scheme enables SUs to efficiently utilize the licensed spectrum shared with PUs in a dynamic environment while maximizing the spectrum utilization.},

	abstract = {Bayesian methods hold significant promise for improving the uncertainty quantification ability and robustness of deep neural network models. Recent research has seen the investigation of a number of approximate Bayesian inference methods for deep neural networks, building on both the variational Bayesian and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) frameworks. A fundamental issue with MCMC methods is that the improvements they enable are obtained at the expense of increased computation time and model storage costs. In this paper, we investigate the potential of sparse network structures to flexibly trade-off model storage costs and inference run time against predictive performance and uncertainty quantification ability. We use stochastic gradient MCMC methods as the core Bayesian inference method and consider a variety of approaches for selecting sparse network structures. Surprisingly, our results show that certain classes of randomly selected substructures can perform as well as substructures derived from state-of-the-art iterative pruning methods while drastically reducing model training times.},

	abstract = {Underlay coexistence is an effective mechanism to improve spectrum effïciency by having picocells coexist with macrocell on the same spectrum. Due to a lack of cooperation between the primary users (PUs) in the macrocell and secondary users (SUs) in the picocell, it is impossible to have complete knowledge of channel gains between them. Under such circumstance, chance-constrained programming (CCP) is shown to be the ideal optimization tool to address such uncertainty. However, solutions to CCP are computationally intensive and cannot meet 5G's timing requirement. To address this problem, we propose a novel scheduler called GUC (stands for GPU-based Underlay Coexistence) to find an approximate solution to CCP in real-time. The essence of GUC is to decompose the original optimization problem into a large number of small problems that are suitable for parallel computation on GPU platforms. Through extensive experiments, we show that GUC reduces the scheduling computation time by at least 10,000 times comparing to commercial solvers (on CPU) while achieving an average of 90\% optimality.},

We show that by setting different risk levels, we are able to achieve a trade-off between controlled throughput violation (risk) and minimum power consumption in the network.

They lead to challenges for real-time control, considering the significant computation load needed to evaluate them in real-time decision processes. This chapter describes the use of computationally effective uncertainty evaluation methods for adaptive optimal control, including learning control and differential games. Two uncertainty evaluation methods are described, the multivariate probabilistic collocation method (MPCM) and its extension the MPCM-OFFD that integrates the MPCM with the orthogonal fractional factorial design (OFFD) to break the curse of dimensionality. These scalable uncertainty evaluation methods are then developed for reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive optimal control. Stochastic differential games, including the two-player zero-sum and multi-player nonzero-sum games, are formulated and investigated. Nash equilibrium solutions for these games are found in real time using the MPCM-based on-policy/off-policy RL methods. Real-world applications on broad-band long-distance aerial networking and strategic air traffic management demonstrate the practical use of MPCM- and MPCM-OFFD-based learning control for uncertain systems.},

	abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged to be an integral component of 5G infrastructure due to its potential to speed up task processing and reduce energy consumption for mobile devices. However, a major technical challenge in making offloading decisions is that the number of required processing cycles of a task is usually unknown in advance. Due to this processing uncertainty, it is difficult to make offloading decisions while providing any guarantee on task deadlines. To address this challenge, we propose EPD---Energy-minimized solution with Probabilistic Deadline guarantee to task offloading problem. The mathematical foundation of EPD is Exact Conic Reformulation (ECR), which is a powerful tool that reformulates a probabilistic constraint for task deadline into a deterministic one. In the absence of distribution knowledge of processing cycles, we use the estimated mean and variance of processing cycles and exploit ECR to the fullest extent in the design of EPD. Simulation results show that EPD successfully guarantees the probabilistic deadlines while minimizing the energy consumption of mobile users, and can achieve significant improvement in energy saving when compared to a state-of-the-art approach.},

In our work, we introduce a new symmetric integration scheme for split HMC that does not rely on stochastic gradients. We show that our new formulation is more efficient than previous approaches and is easy to implement with a single GPU. As a result, we are able to perform full HMC over common deep learning architectures using entire data sets. In addition, when we compare with stochastic gradient MCMC, we show that our method achieves better performance in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification. Our approach demonstrates HMC as a feasible option when considering inference schemes for large-scale machine learning problems.},

The pitfall is illustrated by designing two target detection and classification algorithms. One is based on a recently proposed neural network architecture for embedded AI, and the other is based on a traditional machine learning approach with domain-inspired feature engineering. The neural network approach outperforms the traditional one on test data. Yet, it fails in deployment. The mechanics behind the failure are explained and linked to the way the algorithms are trained. Suggestions are presented to avoid the pitfall. The paper is a “call to arms” to improve the evaluation methodology of machine learning algorithms for mission-critical systems.},

	abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) in the wireless domain, commonly referred to as radio frequency machine learning (RFML), has grown strongly in recent years to solve various problems in the areas of wireless communications, networking, and signal processing. Machine learning has found applications in wireless security such as user equipment (UE) authentication, intrusion detection, and detection of conventional attacks such as jamming and eavesdropping. On the other hand, wireless systems are vulnerable to machine-learning-based security and privacy attack vectors that have recently been considered in other modalities such as computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Adversarial machine learning has emerged as a major threat for wireless systems, given its potential to disrupt the machine learning process. As the wireless medium is open and shared, it provides new means for adversaries to manipulate the testing and training processes of machine learning algorithms. To that end, novel techniques are needed to safeguard the wireless attack surface against adversarial machine learning.},

Our work draws upon stochastic geometry and graph algorithms to propose a general framework to replace the last fully connected layer and softmax output. This framework (a) can be applied to any classifier and (b) significantly reduces the classifier’s overconfidence in its output without much of an impact on its accuracy when compared to original adversarially-trained classifiers. Its relative effectiveness increases as the attacker becomes more powerful. Our use of graph algorithms in adversarial learning is new and of independent interest. Finally, we show the advantages of this last-layer softmax replacement over image tasks under common adversarial attacks.},

	abstract = {Federated learning performed by a decentralized networks of agents is becoming increasingly important with the prevalence of embedded software on autonomous devices. Bayesian approaches to learning benefit from offering more information as to the uncertainty of a random quantity, and Langevin and Hamiltonian methods are effective at realizing sampling from an uncertain distribution with large parameter dimensions. Such methods have only recently appeared in the decentralized setting, and either exclusively use stochastic gradient Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approaches that require a diminishing stepsize to asymptotically sample from the posterior and are known in practice to characterize uncertainty less faithfully than constant step-size methods with a Metropolis adjustment, or assume strong convexity properties of the potential function. We present the first approach to incorporating constant stepsize Metropolis-adjusted HMC in the decentralized sampling framework, show theoretical guarantees for consensus and probability distance to the posterior stationary distribution, and demonstrate their effectiveness numerically on standard real world problems, including decentralized learning of neural networks which is known to be highly non-convex.},

	abstract = {The prevailing approaches in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are often hampered by issues such as high resource consumption, significant computational demands, and poor interpretability. Furthermore, these systems generally struggle to identify novel, rapidly changing cyber threats. This paper delves into the potential of incorporating Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) into NIDS, combining deep learning's data-driven strengths with symbolic AI's logical reasoning to tackle the dynamic challenges in cybersecurity, which also includes detailed NSAI techniques introduction for cyber professionals to explore the potential strengths of NSAI in NIDS. The inclusion of NSAI in NIDS marks potential advancements in both the detection and interpretation of intricate network threats, benefiting from the robust pattern recognition of neural networks and the interpretive prowess of symbolic reasoning. By analyzing network traffic data types and machine learning architectures, we illustrate NSAI's distinctive capability to offer more profound insights into network behavior, thereby improving both detection performance and the adaptability of the system. This merging of technologies not only enhances the functionality of traditional NIDS but also sets the stage for future developments in building more resilient, interpretable, and dynamic defense mechanisms against advanced cyber threats. The continued progress in this area is poised to transform NIDS into a system that is both responsive to known threats and anticipatory of emerging, unseen ones.},

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in analyzing attributed networks in various web-based applications such as social recommendation and web search. Nevertheless, in high-stake decision-making scenarios such as online fraud detection, there is an increasing societal concern that GNNs could make discriminatory decisions towards certain demographic groups. Despite recent explorations on fair GNNs, these works are tailored for a specific GNN model. However, myriads of GNN variants have been proposed for different applications, and it is costly to fine-tune existing debiasing algorithms for each specific GNN architecture. Different from existing works that debias GNN models, we aim to debias the input attributed network to achieve fairer GNNs through feeding GNNs with less biased data. Specifically, we propose novel definitions and metrics to measure the bias in an attributed network, which leads to the optimization objective to mitigate bias. We then develop a framework EDITS to mitigate the bias in attributed networks while maintaining the performance of GNNs in downstream tasks. EDITS works in a model-agnostic manner, i.e., it is independent of any specific GNN. Experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed bias metrics and the superiority of EDITS on both bias mitigation and utility maintenance.
