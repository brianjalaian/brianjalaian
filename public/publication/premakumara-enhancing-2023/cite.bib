 abstract = {Robustness against real-world distribution shifts is crucial for the successful deployment of object detection models in practical applications. In this paper, we address the problem of assessing and enhancing the robustness of object detection models against natural perturbations, such as varying lighting conditions, blur, and brightness. We analyze four state-of-the-art deep neural network models, Detr-ResNet-101, Detr-ResNet-50, YOLOv4, and YOLOv4-tiny, using the COCO 2017 dataset and ExDark dataset. By simulating synthetic perturbations with the AugLy package, we systematically explore the optimal level of synthetic perturbation required to improve the models robustness through data augmentation techniques. Our comprehensive ablation study meticulously evaluates the impact of synthetic perturbations on object detection models performance against real-world distribution shifts, establishing a tangible connection between synthetic augmentation and real-world robustness. Our findings not only substantiate the effectiveness of synthetic perturbations in improving model robustness, but also provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in developing more robust and reliable object detection models tailored for real-world applications.},
